# Automation-Validate-BitLocker-Compliance
This worklet is designed to grant an Admin the ability to check the Bitlocker compliance of a device that falls     within the defined range of System Types. If this Worklet is ran manually, the system type check will be ignored     and all and devices will report drive status to the activity log.
